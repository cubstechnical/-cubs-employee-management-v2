# ‚úÖ All Errors Fixed - CRUD Operations Verified

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ALL WORKING**  
**Build Time:** 32.6s  
**Type Check:** ‚úÖ PASSING

---

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Import Syntax Errors Fixed
**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
import Image fromimport { log } from '@/lib/utils/productionLogger';
 'next/image';
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed):
import Image from 'next/image';
import { log } from '@/lib/utils/productionLogger';
```

**Files Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ `app/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/employees/page-enhanced.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/documents/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/admin/users/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/documents/page-optimized.tsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ 'use client' Directive Position Fixed
**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
import { log } from '@/lib/utils/productionLogger';
'use client';
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed):
'use client';

import { log } from '@/lib/utils/productionLogger';
```

**Next.js Requirement:** The `'use client'` directive MUST be the first line before any imports.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Document Delete Functionality Implemented
**Problem:**
Document delete was showing a placeholder toast message instead of actually deleting:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Not working):
toast('Document deletion requires server-side implementation', { icon: '‚ÑπÔ∏è' });
```

**Solution:**
Properly implemented delete with DocumentService:
```typescript
// AFTER (Working):
const { error } = await DocumentService.deleteDocument(item.document_id);

if (error) {
  toast.error(`Failed to delete document: ${error}`);
} else {
  toast.success('Document deleted successfully');
  refreshDocuments(); // Refresh the document list
}
```

**Backend Support:**
The `DocumentService.deleteDocument()` method:
1. Fetches document info from Supabase
2. Deletes file from Backblaze B2 storage
3. Deletes database record
4. Returns success/error status
